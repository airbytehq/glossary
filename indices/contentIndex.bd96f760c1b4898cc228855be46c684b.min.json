Keep in mind, ethat very new term you create will automatically be created as a page in dthe eployment process or when you run it locally.\n\n### Preview Locally\n#### Setup\nQuartz runs on top of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) so all notes are written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/).\n\nWe need to install golang, hugo-obsidian and hugo. Follow the instructions on [Preview Changes on Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/preview-changes/).\n\n\u003e [!info]\n\u003e \n\u003e If you are running into an error saying that `command not found: hugo-obsidian`, make sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize hugo-obsidian as an executable.\n\nI added to my `~/.zshrc` (or `~/.bashrc`):\n ```sh\n#go path\nexport GOPATH=$HOME/go\nexport PATH=$PATH:$GOROOT/bin:$GOPATH/bin\n```\n#### Run it!\nAll you need to do it goint to your root directory of you cloned repo and start `make serve`:\n```sh\n# Navigate to your local Quartz folder\ncd \u003clocation-of-your-local-quartz\u003e\n\n# Start local server\nmake serve\n\n# View your site in a browser at http://localhost:1313/\n```\nThat's it, from now on that's how you run it. All changes you make will be automatically published, you do not need to stop and restart when you add terms, etc. (only the graph view will only be updated after stopping and serving again).\n\n## How to Publish\nCommit and Push to branch `hugo` and wait a couple of minutes until [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/airbytehq/glossary/actions) will deploy it automatically. At the moment we do not need to create PR's to make the updates as easy as possible. \n\nIf we encounter problems in the future, we might change that.

FROM/JOIN with cte_query ...\n```\n\n## Types: Recursive and Non-Recursive\n### Non-Recursive CTE\nThere are two types of CTEs: Recursive and Non-Recursive.\n\nThe non-recursive are simple where CTE is used to avoid SQL duplication by referencing a name instead of the actual SQL statement.\n\nE.g.\n```sql\nWITH avg_per_store AS\n  (SELECT store, AVG(amount) AS average_order\n   FROM orders\n   GROUP BY store)\nSELECT o.id, o.store, o.amount, avg.average_order AS avg_for_store\nFROM orders o\nJOIN avg_per_store avg\nON o.store = avg.store;\n```\n\n### Recursive CTE\n\nRecursive CTEs use repeated procedural loops therefore the recursion. The recursive query calls itself until the query satisfied the condition. In a recursive CTE, we should provide a where condition to terminate the recursion.\n\nA recursive CTE is useful in querying hierarchical data such as organization charts where one employee reports to a manager or multi-level bill of materials when a product consists of many components, and each component itself also consists of many other components.\n\n```sql\nWITH levels AS (\n  SELECT\n    id,\n    first_name,\n    last_name,\n    superior_id,\n    1 AS level\n  FROM employees\n  WHERE superior_id IS NULL\n  UNION ALL\n  SELECT\n    employees.id,\n    employees.first_name,\n    employees.last_name,\n    employees.superior_id,\n    levels.level + 1\n  FROM employees, levels\n  WHERE employees.superior_id = levels.id\n)\n \nSELECT *\nFROM levels;\n```\n\nSee more on[5 Practical SQL CTE Examples | LearnSQL.com](https://learnsql.com/blog/practical-sql-cte-examples/).","lastmodified":"2022-12-16T12:31:38.152906733Z","tags":null},"/term/cursor":{"title":"What is a Cursor?","content":"At a conceptual level, a cursor is a tracker that is used during [incremental synchronization](term/incremental%20synchronization.md) to ensure that only newly updated or inserted records are sent from a data source to a destination in any given synchronization iteration.\n\nAirbyte’s incremental synchronization can be conceptually thought of as a loop which periodically executes synchronization operations. Each iteration of this loop only replicates records that have been inserted or updated in the source system since the previous execution of this synchronization loop – in other words, each synchronization operation will copy only records that have not previously been replicated by previous synchronizations. This is much more efficient than copying an entire dataset on each iteration, which is the behavior of full refresh synchronization.\n\nSending only updated or newly inserted documents requires tracking which records have already been replicated in previous synchronizations. This is done by a cursor, which can be thought of as a pointer to the most recent record that has been replicated by a given synchronization. When selecting documents for synchronization, Airbyte includes the most recent cursor value as part of the query on the source system to ensure that only new/updated records will be replicated.\n\nFor example, a source database could contain records which include a field called `updated_at`, which stores the most recent time that a record is inserted or updated. If `updated_at` is selected as the cursor field, then after a given synchronization operation the cursor will remember the largest `updated_at` value that has been seen in the records that have been replicated to the destination in that synchronization. In the subsequent synchronization operation, records that have been inserted or updated on the source are retrieved by including the cursor value as part of the query, so that it only selects records where the `updated_at` value is greater than (and in some edge cases greater than or equal to) the largest `updated_at` value seen in the previous synchronization.\n\nNote that while it is not strictly necessary to choose a time field for a cursor field, the field that is chosen should be monotonically increasing over time.\n\nRead more on [Incremental data synchronization between Postgres databases](https://airbyte.com/tutorials/incremental-data-synchronization).

Data is growing exponentially, with 90% of the world’s data being generated alone in the last two years. It's hard to keep this amount over time.

The goal is to generate well-modeled, high-quality, trusted, real-time data.\n\nIt's an **abstraction** that allows engineers to decouple their databases and services from analytics and ML requirements. It will avoid production-breaking incidents when modifying the schema as they are validated and enforced.\n\n![](images/data-contract.png)\nIllustration by Chad Sanderson on [The Rise of Data Contracts - by Chad Sanderson](https://dataproducts.substack.com/p/the-rise-of-data-contracts)\n\n[Chad Sanderson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chad-sanderson/) said that at Convoy, they use [[Protobuf]] and [[Apache Kafka]] to abstract the CRUD transactions. They define the schema based on what they *need*, not what they get from the source. Same as [[Software-Defined Assets]] describe the [Data Asset](term/data%20asset.md) in a declarative manner and set [expectations](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/discussions/9543).\n\nConfluent also built similar functions on top of Kafka with their [Schema Registry](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/schema-registry/), and terms such as [Semantic Layer](term/metrics%20layer.md) and [Analytics API](https://www.sspaeti.com/blog/analytics-api-with-graphql-the-next-level-of-data-engineering/#what-is-an-analytics-api) (with [[GraphQL]]) are trying to achieve similar things.\n\nData Contracts are not meant to replace data pipelines and [Modern Data Stack](term/modern%20data%20stack.md), a more batch approach. These are good for fast prototyping. You could start defining data contracts when you have some knowledge about data.\n\nInterestingly, the differentiation to [Data Mesh](term/data%20mesh.md) is an organizational framework with a micro-service approach to data. Data Mesh doesn't inform which data should be emitted or validate the data being emitted from production is correct or conforms to a consumer's expectations.\n\nAlso, data contracts are a form of [Data Governance](term/data%20governance.md). This term is very vague and gets more concrete with explicit contracts. You can also use [Great Expectations](https://greatexpectations.io/) to set expectations for your data, which I believe is a great way to start.\n\n## From the Discussion on YouTube w/ Chad Sanderson vs Ethan Aaron\n\nChad Sanderson says in [Data Contract Battle Royale w/ Chad Sanderson vs Ethan Aaron - YouTube](https://youtu.be/4BEpYAp3Qu4) :\n- It's just a database version of a real-world contract. \n- A real-world contract is just an agreement between two parties where:\n\t- There's some mechanism for enforcing that it happens. \n\t- A data contract is a similar agreement, but it's **between someone that produces data and consumes data** to vend a particular data set which usually includes a schema and some enforcement mechanism. \n- Differentiation between data contract and data product:\n\t- **Data contract**, which is *what* is the data and *how* do we enforce this quality \n\t- **[Data Product](term/data%20product.md)** which is *why* do we need this data \n\nEthan Aaron is saying his problem with data contracts is that you focus on defining the interface/contract too early. E.g., if you have a big task done by several teams or people, you have a contract to agree on an interface. I'd argue that's precisely what the data products are, and instead of agreeing on some artificial contract, decide on the product, so the tools and teams can be distinct.\n\n## Summary Blog Posts\nAn excellent summary by [Mehdi Ouazza](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mehd-io) about data contracts [From Zero To Hero](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-contracts-from-zero-to-hero-343717ac4d5e).

Data engineering intersects security, data management, DataOps, data architecture, orchestration, and software engineering.\n\nA data engineer today oversees the whole data engineering process, from collecting data from various sources to making it available for downstream processes. The role requires familiarity with the multiple stages of the [Data Engineering Lifecycle](term/data%20engineering%20lifecycle.md) and an aptitude for evaluating data tools for optimal performance across several dimensions, including price, speed, flexibility, scalability, simplicity, reusability, and interoperability.\n\nData Engineering helps also overcome the bottlenecks of [Business Intelligence](term/business%20intelligence.md):\n- More transparency as tools are open-source mostly\n- More frequent data loads\n- Supporting [Machine Learning](term/machine%20learning.md) capabilities \n\nCompared to existing roles it would be a **software engineering plus business intelligence engineer including big data abilities** as the [Hadoop](term/apache%20hadoop.md) ecosystem, streaming, and computation at scale.

Reasons for doing this could be to optimize the data for a different use case than it was originally intended for, or to meet the requirements for storing data in a different system. Data transformation may involve steps such as cleansing, normalizing, [structuring](term/structured%20data.md), validation, sorting, joining, or [enriching](term/data%20enrichment.md) data. \n\n## How is data transformation done\nData is often transformed as part of an [ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)](term/etl.md) or [ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)](term/elt.md) approach to [data integration](https://airbyte.com/blog/data-integration). \n\nSee [ETL vs. ELT](term/etl%20vs%20elt.md) for a comparison of these two approaches.  \n\nAdditionally, a hybrid approach has recently emerged which is known as [EtLT (Extract, “tweak”, Load, Transform)](term/etlt.md). This combines aspects of both ETL and ELT. \n\n## Benefits of data transformation\nWhen used correctly, data transformation can provide the following benefits:\n\n- Improved query-time efficiency and speed. \n- Conversion of data into a format that is required by a target system.\n- Enrichment of data with additional information that allows insights to be more easily extracted.\n- Improved data quality by validating and fixing data, and removal of duplicates. \n\n## Examples of data transformation\nBelow are some examples of how data may be transformed to achieve some of the benefits mentioned above.\n\n### Improved efficiency and speed\nOne kind of transformation could be the extraction of structured data from data that is stored in a string. Imagine data that looks as follows: \n\n```\ninput_string: \"Bob is 29\"\n```\n\nIn order to efficiently process this data in the future, it may preferable to transform this data into additional/new fields, and store it as:\n\n```\nname: \"Bob\"\nage: 29\n```\n\nStoring the data in this manner makes it much more efficient to analyze with operations such as:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM X where Age=29\n```\n\n### Enriching data\n[Data enrichment](data%20enrichment.md) is a data transformation that adds additional information to the data that makes new kinds of queries possible.  \n","lastmodified":"2022-12-16T12:31:38.156906744Z","tags":null},"/term/data-virtualization":{"title":"What is Data Virtualization?","content":"Data Virtualization helps you when you have many source systems from different technologies, but all of them are rather fast in response time, and if you don't run a lot of operational applications.

The DWH serves to be the data integration from many different sources, the single point of truth and the data management, meaning cleaning, historizing, and data joined together.

The need for it often becomes evident when analytic requirements run afoul of the ongoing performance of operational databases. Running a complex query on a database requires the database to enter a temporarily fixed state. It is often untenable for transactional databases.

Examples of metrics could be \"monthly active users\", \"weekly revenue\", \"number of paying customers\", and so on.\n\nYou can think of a semantic layer as a translation layer between any data presentation layer ([business intelligence](term/business%20intelligence.md), [notebooks](term/notebooks.md), data apps) and the data sources. A translation layer includes many features, such as integrating data sources, modeling the metrics, and integrating with the data consumers by translating metrics into [SQL](term/sql.md), REST, or GraphQL.\n\nBecause everyone has different definitions of “active” users or “paying” customers, the semantic layer allows you to define these discrepancies once company-wide. Instead of having three different versions each presentation tool e.g. BI tool would show a different number than your Jupyter notebook or data app. And what if the metric changes to a new definition, with a semantic layer you change only one time.

These asset definitions, version-controlled through git and inspectable via tooling, allow anyone in your organization to understand your canonical set of data assets, enable you to reproduce them at any time, and offer a foundation for asset-based orchestration.\n\nThe key to software-defined assets is to declare a data asset/product pre-runtime. The SW-defined function in Dagster is like a microservice or the code that defines the asset in a  [functional way](term/functional%20data%20engineering.md) (that can live independently). With the declarative approach, we have more information defined as code helping the [orchestrator](term/data%20orchestrator.md) to figure out the lineage, how to run, etc. \n\nThe best thing, you get the actual data lineage of your physical assets, not an arbitrary lineage of tasks (that is interesting for engineers but not for data consumers).\n\nIn the future, more code will be written with SW-defined assets as it reduces the need for writing lots of boilerplate as it's declarative and describes what the asset is supposed to do and include rather than how that is handled and run by Dagster.

Examples of structured fields could be age, name, phone number, credit card numbers or address. Storing data in a structured format allows it to be easily understood and queried by machines and with tools such as SQL.\n\n## Example of structure data\n\nBelow is an example of structured data as it would appear in a database:\n\n|         |  **age**| **name**| **phone**| \n|---------|-----|------|-----|\n|Record 1| 29 | Bob | 123-456 |\n|Record 2| 30 | Sue | 789-123 | \n\nIt may seem that all data is structured, but this is not always the case -- data can be unstructured, or semi-structured. The differences are best understood by example, and are discussed in the following sections. \n\n## Structured data vs. unstructured data\n\nStructured data can be contrasted with [unstructured data](term/unstructured%20data.md), which does not conform to a data model and has no easily identifiable structure. Unstructured data cannot be easily used by programs, and is difficult to analyze. Examples of unstructured data could be the contents of an email, contents of a word document, data from social media, photos, videos, survey results, etc.   \n\nAn simple example of unstructured data is a string that contains interesting information inside of it, but that has not been formatted into a well defined schema. An example is given below:\n\n|               |  **UnstructuredString**|\n|---------| -----------|\n|Record 1| \"Bob is 29\" |\n|Record 2| \"Mary just turned 30\"|\n\n## Structuring of unstructured data\n\nConverting unstructured data into structured data can be done during the [data transformation](term/data%20transformation.md) stage in an [ETL](term/etl.md) or [ELT](term/elt.md) process.  \n\nFor example, in order to efficiently make use of the unstructured data given in the previous example, it may desirable to transform it into structured data such as the following:\n\n|               |  **name** | **age** |\n|---------| -----------|---- |\n|Record 1| \"Bob\" | 29 |\n|Record 2| \"Mary\"| 30 |\n\nStoring the data in a structured manner makes it much more efficient to query the data. For example, after structuring the data it is possible to easily and efficiently execute the following query on the structured data:\n  \n``` SQL\nSELECT * FROM X where Age=29\n```\n\nA query such as this would be expensive and/or more difficult to execute on unstructured data.\n\n## Structured data vs. semi-structured data\n\nStructured data can also be contrasted with [semi-structured data](term/semi-structured%20data.md), which lacks a rigid structure and does not conform directly to a data model. However, semi-structured data has tags and elements that describe the data. \n\nExamples of semi-structured data are JSON or XML files.
