title: "What is the Open Data Stack?"

The open data stack is a better term for the [Modern Data Stack](term/modern%20data%20stack.md) but focuses on solutions built on open-source and open standards covering the [Data Engineering Lifecycle](term/data%20engineering%20lifecycle.md). The open data stack is maintained by everyone using it. Companies can reuse existing battle-tested solutions and build on them instead of reinventing the wheel by re-implementing critical components for each component of the data stack.

The *open* piece is so important and often overlooked because itâ€™s what makes the #opendatastack more embeddable with tools from the open data stack such as [Airbyte](term/airbyte.md), [dbt](dbt), [Dagster](Dagster), [Superset](term/apache%20superset), and so forth. Letting you integrate them into your services, unlike closed-source services.

Alternative names that came up beside the Modern Data Stack are [ngods (new generation open-source data stack)](https://blog.devgenius.io/modern-data-stack-demo-5d75dcdfba50), [DataStack 2.0](https://dagster.io/blog/evolution-iq-case-study), [DAD Stack](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/11fhmqu/comment/jajkydk/?context=3), or more as a joke on Twitter, the boring data stack.
