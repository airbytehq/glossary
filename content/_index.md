# A Single Place for All Data Knowledge
Welcome to the Data Glossary, a one-stop-shop for data-related concepts. Inspired by the [Digital Garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought/) analogy, this interactive platform offers a comprehensive collection of data terms, covering various topics. The [Data Glossary](term/about%20this%20glossary.md) aims to help you expand your data knowledge and uncover new insights. Happy learning!

# Navigation
There are multiple ways to navigate my Second Brain:

1. Use the search bar on the top right or press `cmd+k` (`ctrl+k` on Windows) or click on the Search button (top right) to search for any term.
2. Click on a note to explore its content, and follow the links and backlinks to dive deeper into related topics.
3. Interact with the graph at the bottom of the page to visualize connections between notes and click on any node to navigate directly to that note.
4. Click on the [Hashtags](tags) to explore the topics by tags.
